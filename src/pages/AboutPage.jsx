        About us
      </h2>
      <p>
            <b>Gully Closet</b><br/> Was established in 2016,
            as a reselling and styling company by
            Lethabo Pilane.<br/>
            
          
            Specializing in brands like Bape, Carhartt
            Daily x Paper, Nike, Vetements, Stussy and many more...
      </p>
      <p>
            <b>Why</b><br/>
            Inspired by a Documentary called "The True Cost",that hightlights 
            the effects of fast fashion on the planet and labor conditions of the 
            people working behind the scenes in sweat shops.<br/>

            I believe fashion should tell a story — not just about trends, but about the craft,
            the history, and the people behind each piece. In a world of fast fashion,
            I choose to focus on quality, authenticity, and individuality. My goal is to blend the
            elegance of the past with the freshness of today, creating style that lasts and has meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
            <b>What I do</b><br/>
            I sell, consign, style, and design with intention. My work draws inspiration from different eras,
            but always keeps the look modern and personal to the wearer. For any occasion or season, I create outfits that feel unique and true to each client’s taste. I also collaborate with emerging local and international brands, using their pieces in creative projects that give them fresh exposure and open doors to new markets.

            If you value style with depth and quality that endures, I invite you to connect with me — whether to collaborate, style, or shop my carefully curated collection.
